(2015) (Cited: 975) [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)  There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.

(2013) (Cited: 518) [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5926.pdf) In this paper, we formulate saliency map computation as a regression problem. Our method, which is based on multi-level image segmentation, utilizes the supervised learning approach to map the regional feature vector to a saliency score.
- Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild, by Ziwei L., Ping L., Xiaogang W. & Xiaoou T. (2015) (Cited: 401) [[pdf]](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Liu_Deep_Learning_Face_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf) This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation. (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies. (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with imagelevel attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations.
